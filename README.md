### Getting Started

The repo is broken up into separate lessons. Each lesson has a `start` and `finished` part
that allow you to start from scratch and also view the final code for the lesson. The convention
for running the code for a certain lesson follows: `pnpm run <lesson-number>:<part>`.

**Example**
`pnpm run 01:start` - Will run the code in the `start` section of the lesson
`pnpm run 01:finished` - Will run the code for the `finished` section of the lesson

## Foundations Of Classes
